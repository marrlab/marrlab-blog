  <h2>Corona has fundamentally changed the way computational researchers work: We have learned that we can concentrate at small desks at home. That virtual meetings can be efficient. That we have to spend less time on trains and planes during travels. And: We have developed a new Journal Club format: Read & Meet (the Author). 
This is how we do it: After we have agreed on a recent interesting publication, we invite the corresponding author(s) to discuss their work with us. The rules for our lab members are straightforward: everyone who wants to join has to have read the paper and should prepare at least one question. For the authors, no preparation is required. We meet for one hour, according to the author's time zone. After a short introduction by one of the lab members, questions regarding the publication are directed to the author and discussed. This takes typically around half an hour. Afterwards, we go through figures, results, and relevant methods. After 60 minutes, the author has the last word. 
We noticed that the presence of the author changed the character of our journal club.  The new format stimulates direct and detailed discussion, increasing awareness for colleagues' work. Questions like 'Why did they do it this way?’ are now addressed jointly, background information are shared, methods are debated, and ideally, new ideas are developed together.
So far, we had 18 Read & Meet sessions. 14 authors responded to our invitation email where we explained our format, eleven of them joined our virtual meeting, answering questions and participating in the discussion.
The new format has turned out to be key to get to know our colleagues’ work, approach and personality, and to expand our scientific network. For authors, it provides a platform for presenting published results and receiving detailed feedback from genuinely interested peers. Some first authors were extremely grateful for the invitation: “This is the first time this has happened to me. It's great to see that someone is so deeply interested in my work".
The pandemic has shown us that there are many ways to work together, and even  more efficiently than before. We should continue developing innovative formats, try them out and share them with others.
